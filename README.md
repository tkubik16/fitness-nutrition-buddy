<h1>Fitness and Nutrition Buddy Android App</h1>

The database is no longer live and the NutritionIX API key is no longer active so the project cannot be utilized but here are screenshots from the app when it was functioning. This was a group project of four people from a course I took at UIC called Software Engineering 2.

Above we can see the login and register page that is the same as the second release.

The profile screen as seen above got more tracking bars for nutrition goals and limits as set by the chosen meal plan.

</div>
The profile also has a tab for workouts where the calories burned in the different types of workouts is tracked. Also as seen above the preferences control was added to the profile settings which is located under the pencil icon on the profile page. The preferences are used to filter the menu items that are shown when a restaurant is selected from the map screen.

</div>
Above we can see the home page which now contains the meals and workouts tabs which will show the meals and workouts from the current day chosen which is adjustable at the top by the left and right arrows. The meals are also editable if they are clicked on and this is shown in the upper right image. 
<br></br>

</div>
The home page also has a workouts tab where you can see the workouts that have been logged on what days as well as the ability to edit those workouts. This can be seen above.
<br></br>
<br></br>

<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12_tVOjzZo0rJo11vmfjYwfNvMzqphezW" alt="Meal history calendar" title="Meal history calendar" height="600">
</div>
If the user clicks the red button with the date at the top of the profile page they can view a meal history calendar as seen above. The user can choose a day and view the meals logged on those days.

</div>
From the search page users can search for foods and even preselect what category for it to go into. When a user searches for a food they are shown a list of meals and four macronutrients for that meal item. The meal items are still queried from the NutritionIX API. The main change to this function is that the meal list items show the calories, protein, fat and sugars for each meal item.
<br></br>
<br></br>

<div>
<img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1xzW1ZtdgH1ZoMkr33F2-Z14tpzwYgzpE" alt="Search Page Add food" title="Search Page Add food" height="600">

</div>
As seen above the user can select a food from the search page and edit what meal you ate it for and add the food to the meal log. In the above right image is the custom meal activity which is not completely new but can now be accessed from the search screen and has the ability to enter the macronutrients for the meal being added.

</div>
On the map page of the application as seen in the above left image the user location is used to show restaurants nearby and a list of those restaurants. If the user selects a restaurant the menu items are obtained from the branded section of the NutritionIX database and the menu items shown are filtered by the users preferences. The meal items here also show the amount of calories, protein, fat, and sugars.

</div>
Above we can see the meal plans in the plans section of the application where a user can select a meal plan. The effect this has is the nutrition goals on the profile page are changed to have different values for the different macronutrients. The nutrition goal number and the nutrition limit numbers will be adjusted based on the meal plan chosen.
<br></br>

</div>
Just like for meal plans the application also has workout plans and these adjust the workout goals shown in the bars on the workout section of the profile page.

</div>
Above we can see the ability to search for a workout the user has done to add it to their workout log. This uses the natural language search function from NutritionIX.
